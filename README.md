<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
First things first, make sure to log on to your virtual machine and log on to osTicket as an admin, and make sure you delete the maintenance department. Once that is done you can log out and proceed to create a ticket as an end-user. Visit the end-user login page and click Create New. Go ahead and create a ticket named "entire mobile/online banking system is down" and put Report a Problem as the topic. Make sure you use the login credentials of the end-user you created in the last lab as well. Once the ticket is created, go ahead and log on as one of your agents, specifically John Doe, once logged in you should be able to see the created ticket, go ahead and open it and observe it. After that, you should set the priority to Sev-A as a critical outage would lead to a big impact on business and assign it to the online banking department. Once that is done, go ahead and log out and log back in as Jane Doe, due to her being in the online banking department, to finish the ticket to completion.

From here create a second ticket as an end-user with the following name: "accounting department needs adobe upgrade, broken" and put the topic as "General Inquiry/Other". Log in as John and observe the ticket and set it's Priorites to Sev-c and assign it to the support department. Since John is in the support department, stay logged in as him and work the ticket to completion.

Finally we're going to create our last ticket, as an end-user create the following ticket "CFOâ€™s laptop will no longer turn on" and put the topic as "report a problem/personal computer issue". Login as John, observe the ticket, and set it as Sev-B and assign it to the support department. Again John is the agent in support, and so stay logged in and work the last ticket to completion.
